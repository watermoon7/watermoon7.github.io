        <h1>Thinking concurrently</h1>
        <p>
            Thinking concurrently is a method used when solving computational problems.
            Concurrent processing means different tasks are assigned slices of time by a processor,
            giving the illusion that the tasks are being completed simultaneously.
            Similarly, concurrent thinking is completing tasks at the same time to decrease the amount of time to solve a problem.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, you are given two tasks.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Record the number plate of each car that passes you in a given timeframe</li>
            <li>Record the color of each car that passes you in a given timeframe</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            Instead of completing the tasks individually at different times, you can apply concurrent thinking and complete them at the same time.
        </p>
