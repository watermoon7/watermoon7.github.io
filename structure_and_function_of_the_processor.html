    <h1>Structure and function of the processor</h1>

    <h2>Layout of a CPU</h2>
    <p>A CPU consists of an <b>arithmetic logic unit (ALU)</b>, which completes arithmetic and logical operations, a <b>control unit (CU)</b>, which decodes instructions and coordinates the activities of the CPU, as well as several <b>registers</b> and <b>buses</b>.</p>
    <label>Registers</label>
    <ul>
        <li>Program counter (PC) - holds the address of the next instruction</li>
        <li>Accumulator (ACC) - holds results from calculations</li>
        <li>Memory address register (MAR) - holds an address currently in use, e.g. to be read or written to</li>
        <li>Memory data register (MDR) - holds data currently in use</li>
        <li>Current instruction register (CIR) - holds the current instruction</li>
    </ul>
    <label>Buses</label>
    <ul>
        <li>Data bus — a bidirectional bus that transfers data and instructions between components</li>
        <li>Address bus — used to transfer addresses between components</li>
        <li>Control bus — a bidirectional bus that is used to transfer control signals sent from the CU</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Each instruction can be split into two parts. The <b>opcode</b> and the <b>operand</b>. The opcode contains the operation — for example, fetch or add, and the operand contains the data to be operated on.</p>

    <img src="instruction_example.png" width="800rem">
    <p>The addressing mode section defines how the data bus retrieves the instruction if necessary. There are four main types of addressing modes.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Immediate addressing — the operand is the data to be used e.g. <b>LOAD #5</b> will load value 5</li>
        <li>Direct addressing — the operand's memory address holds the data to be used e.g. <b>LOAD 500</b> will load the value in memory location 500</li>
        <li>Indirect addressing — the operand's memory address is the location of the data to be used e.g. <b>LOAD (500)</b> will load the value found at the memory address specified in memory location 500</li>
        <li>Indexed addressing — the operand's memory address <b>plus some constant</b> holds the data to be used e.g. <b>LOAD 500, X</b> will load the value in memory location 500+X</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Fetch Decode Execute Cycle (FDE cycle)</h2>
    <p>The FDE cycle is a <b>sequence of operations</b> to execute an instruction.</p>
    <label>Fetch phase</label>
    <ol>
        <li>Address from the PC is copied to the MAR (by the address bus)</li>
        <li>The data at the address is fetched and stored in the MDR (by the data bus)</li>
        <li><b>Simultaneously</b>, the PC is incremented by 1</li>
        <li>The data in the MDR is copied to the CIR (by the data bus)</li>
    </ol>
    <label>Decode phase</label>
    <ol start=5>
        <li>The contents of the CIR are split into the operand and opcode</li>
        <li>The opcode is sent to the CU (by the data bus) and is decoded</li>
    </ol>
    <label>Execute phase</label>
    <ol start=7>
        <li>The CU directs the execution of the opcode e.g., signals the ALU to perform a logic operation</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Factors affecting the performance of a CPU</h2>
    <label>There are three physical factors which affect the performance of a CPU</label>
    <ul>
        <li>Clock speed (Hz) — the number of cycles performed in the CPU per second</li>
        <li>Number of cores — a core is an independent processor capable of running its own FDE cycle</li>
        <li>Cache size — memory inside the CPU which holds commonly used instructions. Cache is fast because it is physically close to the other components of the CPU</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When it comes to clock speed, the faster, the better. However, more cores and higher cache size are not always better for performance. Some programs only work on a single core, so the other cores aren't used. The number of cores affecting the performance of a CPU depends on which program is running and how the program is coded. The size of the cache is limited by the amount of space is a CPU. The larger the CPU, the further the cache is from key components, which slows down retrieval.</p>

    <h3>Pipelining</h3>
    <p>In the FDE cycle, while one instruction is being executed, another can be fetched and another can be decoded meaning <b>three instructions are on the FDE cycle at the same time</b>. This reduces idle time in the CPU; however, it can lead to errors — for example, the instruction being executed changes a value in memory <b>after</b> it has been fetched.</p>


    <h2>Different Architectures</h2>
    <p>Von Neumann architecture</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Data and instructions are stored in the same location, and the data bus is used for both data and instructions</li>
        <li>Advantages include: cheaper to develop, as the CU is easier to design, programs can be optimised in size</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Harvard architecture</p>
    <ul>
        <li>There are separate memories for data and instructions as well as separate buses for data and instructions</li>
        <li>Advantages include: faster execution as data and instructions can be fetched in parallel, the memories can be different sizes depending on your requirements</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Contemporary processing</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A combination of Von Neumann and Harvard architecture - Von Neumann is used when working with data and instructions from the main memory, whereas Harvard is used to divide cache into instructions and data</li>
    </ul>
