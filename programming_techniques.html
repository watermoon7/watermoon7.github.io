        <h1>Programming techniques</h1>
        <p>This page describes several programming techniques used in professional programming.</p>

        <h2>Programming constructs</h2>
        <p>There are three main programming constructs </p>
        <h3>Sequencing</h3>
        <p>
            Code is executed line by line from the top to the bottom.
        </p>
        <h3>Iteration</h3>
        <p>
            The same code is run multiple times.
            If the code is repeated a known number of times, this is called count controlled iteration.
            If not, then it is called condition controlled iteration.
        </p>
        <h3>Selection/ branching</h3>
        <p>
            Certain lines of code are only executed if a condition is met.
        </p>

        <h2>Recursion</h2>
        <p>
            Recursion is where a subroutine calls itself. Here is a visual to explain recursion:
        </p>

        <p>
            Recursion is used when the depth of a problem is unknown.
            This can be useful for searching trees, querying databases or even mathematical functions. For example:
        </p>
        <img src="recursion_example.png">
        <p>This function calculates the
            <span class="definition" data-definition="The product of all numbers from 1 to n where n is a positive integer"><u>factorial</u></span>
            of a number using recursion. It does this by calling itself until the terminating condition is met.
            A terminating condition is the condition that stops the recursion.
        </p>

        <h2>Global and local variables</h2>
        <p>
            Global variables are variables that can be referenced or edited anywhere in a program.
        </p>
        <p>
            Local variables are variables that can only be referenced or edited within a certain code block.
        </p>

        <h2>Modularity</h2>
        <p>
            Modular programming is the process of splitting large or complex programs into smaller, self-contained modules.
            A modular design makes it easy to divide tasks between a team, test or modify parts of the program individually,
            and improves the reusability of components – once a module has been tested, it can be used again.
        </p>

        <h2>By reference and by value</h2>
        <p>
            When parameters are passed into a function or procedure, they can be passed by value or by reference.
            Passing a parameter by value makes a copy of the value to pass into the function,
            whereas passing by reference gives the address of the parameter.
        </p>
        <label>Here is an example of how to pass by reference and by value in Pseudocode:</label>

        <h2>Use of IDEs to develop and debug programs</h2>
        <p>
            An IDE (integrated development environment) is a program used to develop and debug code.
            Some examples include VS-Code, VS-Studio, IDLE, Vim, Atom, SublimeText, and Eclipse.
        </p>
        <label>Here are some common features of IDEs:</label>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Stepping – allows stepping through code line by line
            </li>
            <li>
                Breakpoints – sets a point in the program to stop
            </li>
            <li>
                Code autocompletion – algorithms predict what you are going to type and make suggestions
            </li>
            <li>
                Syntax highlighting – certain keywords are highlighted different colours
            </li>
            <li>
                Debugging tools – runtime detection of errors and diagnostics tools
            </li>
        </ul>
