        <h1>Thinking procedurally</h1>
        <p>
            Thinking procedurally is a method used when solving computational problems.
            The first stage of the method involves breaking the problem into smaller subproblems.
            This process is called problem decomposition and can be represented as a <b>structure diagram</b> as shown in the example below.

            The next stage is to identify the lowest-level components of the problem.
            In a structure diagram, the lowest-level components are the problems which aren't broken down into further subproblems.
        </p>
        <p>
            The final stage of thinking procedurally is to decide the order in which to code the lowest-level components of the problem.
            Some components will depend on others having already been coded, and so the other of completion is important.
