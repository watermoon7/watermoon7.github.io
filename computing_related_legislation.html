    <h1>Computing related legislation</h1>

    <h2><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/29/contents">The Data Protection Act 1998</a></h2>
    <p>This law applies to <b>personal data stored on computers</b> (or in paper filing systems). Examples of personal data are a person's name or address.</p>

    <label>There are eight ways in which the law projects personal data:</label>
    <ol type="i">

        <li>Personal data must be processed fairly and lawfully</li>
        <li>Personal data must be obtained for a lawful purpose</li>
        <li>Personal data must be accurate and up to date</li>
        <li>Personal data must not be excessive for its purpose</li>
        <li>Personal data must be kept for longer than necessary</li>
        <li>There must be appropriate measures to protect from theft of, damage to or loss of personal data</li>
        <li>Personal data must not be transferred to a country outside the European economic area unless there is an adequate level of data protection</li>
        <li>Personal data must be processed with the rights outlined in this act</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The act also gives data subjects certain rights such as the <b>right to request a copy of the data being held on them</b>.</p>

    <h2><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1990/18/contents">The Computer Misuse Act 1990</a></h2>
    <p>This law outlines three primary offences concerning malicious use of computers:</p>

    <ol type="i">
        <li>Unauthorised access to computer materials</li>
        <li>Unauthorised access with the intent to commit further offences</li>
        <li>Unauthorised modification of computer materials</li>
    </ol>
 
    <p>Each offence can be punished with <b>imprisonment</b>.</p>

    <h2><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/contents">The Copyright, Design and Patents Act 1988</a></h2>
    <p>This act protects people's property online. It automatically applies to original content including <b>music, art, videos, code and literary work</b>.</p>
    <label>The owner and any other authorised individuals can:</label>
    <ol type="i">
        <li>copy the work</li>
        <li>sell the work to the public</li>
        <li>rent or lend the work to the public</li>
        <li>show the work to the public</li>
        <li>make an adaption of the work, or do any of the above with the adaption</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Copyright is infringed if <b>any unauthorised person does any of the actions listed above</b>.</p>
    <p>It is an individual's responsibility to take action under the act.</p>

    <h2><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/23/contents">The Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000</a></h2>
    <p>This act covers investigation, surveillance and interception of communication by public bodies. For example, the secret service can wire-tap online conversations (<b>in the interest of national security</b>) given a warrant has been issued.</p>
    <p>This act also enforces some laws on internet service providers and mobile phone companies such as:</p>
    <ol type="i">
        <li>upon request, information must be given up to authorised authorities</li>
        <li>networks must have sufficient hardware to <b>facilitate surveillance</b></li>
    </ol>
    <p>This act is controversial as it extends to small agencies like local councils. In addition, some people feel that the act is an invasion of privacy.</p>
